# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Import math module.
### Step 2: give the two co-ordinates for finding diatance.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: Use the in-built sqrt function to find the distance.
### Step 5: Print the value of distance.
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1,y1=4,2
x2,y2=10,6
distance=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)
print("{0:.2f}".format(distance))
```

### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the program to find the distance between two points executed successfully.
